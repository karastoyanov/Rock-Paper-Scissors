## A game of Rock-Paper-Scissors :rock: :page_with_curl: :scissors:

#####  Simple game of rock-paper-scissors with graphical user interface. Lead the humanity against the AI in a deadly game for our race survival. The rules are simple, get into the role of a private soldier, part of the last surviving humans and defent us against the machines who took over the world. 
#####  Each round you will have to choose your weapon - a rock, a paper or a pair of scissors and fight against the artificial intelligence who is trying to purge the humanity from the face of the planet. 

### :hammer_and_wrench: Game mechanics:

##### The player can choose one the three buttons - rock, paper or scissors and play versus the computer, who randomly selects his choice. Based on the result, each round can give you a point or a point for the AI. In case of Tie, no points are added to none of the players.
##### Also, after each round, depending on the results, a text message will be generated and will appear on the screen. 
##### On the bottom of the screen the player can track the overall results. At this point there is no limit and the game can continue indefinitely.

### :desktop_computer: Technologies used:

##### The application is written in Python. The entire GUI is written in QT Framework v5 using the respective python libraries `pyqt5` and `pyqt5-tools`.
